  Uttarakhand tunnel collapse LIVE updates: The operations to rescue the 41 workers trapped inside the Silkyara tunnel in Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi entered the 15th day on Sunday, with the vertical drilling expected to commence in the afternoon.      Rescue operations still in progress at Uttarakhand tunnel collapse site (File Photo)    The final phase of the rescue operations has been hit by repeated snags, with the American auger machine hitting a metal grinder in the rubble and breaking down, now being beyond repair. After the horizontal drilling using the American auger didn't pan out, the agencies are considering moving forward with the vertical drilling method.Only 10 per cent of the tunnel rubble is left to be drilled to insert the steel pipe through which the 41 trapped workers will be wheeled out of the wreckage using stretchers.Experts have detected that only about 10-12 metres of drilling is required, and there is currently no metal obstruction which could cause a snag in the rescue operations.If vertical drilling doesn't help in rescuing the workers, agencies have said that they will commence manual drilling, which is their last resort.Manual drilling of the tunnel rubble will have fewer risks but will be less efficient, as it will take another 18-24 hours to complete.
