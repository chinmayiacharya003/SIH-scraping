<p>Aizawl (Mizoram) [India], November 5 (ANI): Bharatiya Janata Party leader Numal Momin on Saturday said that this time the party will show a better performance in the Mizoram Assembly elections, to be held two days later, and will bag 6-8 seats.<br/>Deputy Speaker of the Assam Assembly, Momin, who is also the star campaigner of the BJP in the only northeastern state among the five states going to polls next week, said that this time the party's vote share will also be increased to 15 per cent. <br/>Elections for the 40-member Mizoram Assembly are scheduled to be held on November 7. The counting of votes will be done on December 3. <br/>In the 2018 assembly election in Mizoram, the BJP contested 39 seats and won 1 seat with a vote share of 8.09 per cent.<br/>"This time, the BJP's vote share will also be increased, and it will go up to 15 per cent. We will win 6-8 seats in Mizoram this time," Dr Numal Momin told ANI.<br/>He further said that, in this election, the BJP is fighting for the development and a better future of Mizoram.<br/>"We are fighting in this election for infrastructure development, education, the health sector, and communication. This time, people are very upset with the present government. Many people come into contact with us. Many Zoram People's Movement (ZPM) leaders and the village council president joined us for development," he said.<br/>Momin said, "Various leaders of MNF, ZPM, and Congress have joined the BJP, and they are very angry with the present MNF government." "This time we are contesting 23 seats, and we will win 6-8 seats in Mizoram. We will be in a very comfortable position to become kingmakers in the coming government," he added.<br/>Lashing out at Chief Minister Zoramthanga's government further, he said, "The condition of the roads in Mizoram is very bad. I think the people of Mizoram will vote for the BJP in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and it will be the victory of PM Modi's good governance and development."<br/>He also said that there are so many issues in Mizoram, but no political parties are able to address them.<br/>"The unemployment problem is always here. The issues of youth empowerment, women empowerment, and, basically, the education sector are also there. The literacy rate in Mizoram is 100 per cent, but despite that, many remote areas of the state have only up to ME school, not above. I have visited many remote areas of the state and seen the education system. If this type of education system is running, I don't think that Mizoram will progress. Only a few people get the opportunity to study abroad, but in remote areas, people don't get that opportunity in this Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebration. The people of the rural areas of Mizoram are yet to get the taste of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. We need to do a lot for the poor people of Mizoram," he added. (ANI)</p>
