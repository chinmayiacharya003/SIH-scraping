Corruption worth crores of rupees occurred in the purchase of hospital equipment and the entire country heard the echo of the nursing scam that happened in the state," Sapra said.<br/>There are 75000 sanctioned posts for doctors in the state, but only 3500 have been filled yet. Many medical institutions and pathologies are running without permission, and government people are extorting money from them, the <a href="/topic/congress">congress</a> leader alleged.<br/>He further said, "According to the CAG report, money was taken from the government on the pretext of treatment of dead bodies in Ayushman Yojana in <a href="/topic/madhya-pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a>. The families of those who died during the COVID-19 pandemic did not receive compensation yet."<br/>The Congress leader also said that as soon as the Congress government came to power in the state after the forthcoming state <a href="/topic/assembly-polls">assembly polls</a>, they would re-investigate it and take action against the accused.<br/>He also launched an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that the PM had put his photo on the vaccination certificate but did not put his photo on the death certificate of the person who died due to a lack of oxygen and Remdesivir.<br/></p><p>"State Congress chief Kamal Nath has promised the people of the state that all these cases will be investigated. Apart from this, health insurance of Rs 25 lakh and accident insurance of Rs 10 lakh will be given unconditionally to the people. The Old Pension Scheme will be implemented, shops will be opened for cheap medicines, and doctors will be recruited," Sapra said.<br/>Reacting to Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia's remark that Congress distributed fake loan waiver certificates to farmers, Sapra said that he (Scindia) was lying.<br/>"If it was so then why did Scindia not raise his voice at that time keeping his morality aside. He (Scindia) is lying," he added.<br/>Notably, addressing a public rally in Ashoknagar district on Friday, Scindia said, "26 lakh fake certificates were distributed in the name of loan waivers to farmers. I even distributed some of those certificates. There is an old saying- Jhoot Bole Kauva Kate, Kaale Kauve Se Darriyo. I am the black crow for the Congress."<br/>Meanwhile, speaking about the Enforcement Directorate (ED)'s claim that Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel was allegedly paid Rs 508 crore by Mahadev app promoters, the Congress leader said that all this thing was politically motivated. They (<a href="/topic/bjp">BJP</a>) wanted to win the elections with ED and IT.<br/>"All this is politically motivated. The <a href="/topic/bjp">BJP</a> is seeing that they are losing badly in Chhattisgarh, and PM Modi magic is not going to work there; therefore they (<a href="/topic/bjp">BJP</a>) want to win the elections with ED and IT," he added.<br/><a href="/topic/madhya-pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> and Chhattisgarh are two of the five states set to hold elections this month. <a href="/topic/madhya-pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> is scheduled to undergo polls in one phase on November 17.
