NEW DELHI: Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma's aggressive approach and consistent performance at the top of the order in the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023 have earned him praise from batting coach Vikram Rathour. Despite scoring just one century (131) and two fifties from eight matches, Rohit's dynamic starts have significantly benefited the Indian team.During the recent match against South Africa, Rohit Sharma's quickfire 40 off 24 balls set the tone for India.The team scored an imposing 326 for 5 after opting to bat first, and South Africa was dismissed for a mere 83, resulting in a massive 243-run win.Rathour attributed this attacking approach to Rohit himself, stating, "It's absolutely Rohit's idea. He's taking the initiative. If there's something on the wicket, he's looking to go for his shots. It is working out really well for the team. He's one guy who's leading with his action."In the same match, Rohit Sharma, along with Shubman Gill, took charge against South Africa's new-ball bowlers Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen, disrupting their rhythm and allowing India to reach 91 for 1 in the powerplay. This opening stand eased the pressure on Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer in the middle overs, enabling them to accelerate the run-rate.Rathour appreciated this strategic move, saying, "We're looking to score as many runs as we can. The start that Rohit and Gill provided helped Virat and Shreyas to settle down and take their time. That was a great strategy, and it worked out well."Rathour also praised Shreyas Iyer, who played a pivotal role in the match with his valuable 77 off 87 balls and contributed to a match-turning 134-run partnership with Kohli. "He (Iyer) always plays like this, he has scored a lot of runs for the team for the last two years. One-two bad matches does not make a difference; we're always sure how he can contribute to the team," said Rathour, emphasising Iyer's consistent contributions.India have maintained an impeccable winning streak in the tournament, securing their spot in the semifinals with eight consecutive victories. They currently lead the points table as they head into the knockout phase.Rathour highlighted the team's focus on their cricket and not worrying about the opposition as a key factor in their success. He affirmed that this approach will remain unchanged as they prepare for their next match against the Netherlands in Bengaluru on November 12. (With inputs from PTI)
