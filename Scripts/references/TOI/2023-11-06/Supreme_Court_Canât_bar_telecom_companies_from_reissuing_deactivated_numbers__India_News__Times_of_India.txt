NEW DELHI: There is bad news for those subscribers who prefer prepaid mobile numbers and often change their numbers. The Supreme Court has said mobile phone service providers cannot be barred from reallocating deactivated/disconnected numbers to new subscribers after expiry of the statutory 90-day period and that it was for subscribers to delete data shared on WhatsApp or otherwise.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti dismissed a petition by advocate Rajeshwari, who had sought a direction to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to instruct mobile service providers to stop issuing deactivated mobile numbers to new customers. Trai, through advocate Sanjay Kapur, told the SC that reallocation of deactivated mobile numbers related to administration of ânumbering resourcesâ, which squarely fell within the domain of the department of telecommunications.The Justice Khanna-led bench said, âWe are not inclined to proceed further with the present writ petition, as it is clear from the counter affidavit filed by Trai that the mobile telephone number, once deactivated for non-usage or disconnected on the request of the subscriber, is not allocated to a new subscriber for at least a period of 90 days. It is for the earlier subscriber to take adequate steps to ensure that privacy is maintained.âOn the petitionerâs concern about breach of confidential data, the bench said, âThe subscriber can prevent misuse of WhatsApp data by deleting the WhatsApp account attached with the previous phone number and erasing the WhatsApp data stored on the local device memory/cloud/drive.In its affidavit, Trai informed the SC that DoT in April 2017 had issued two instructions conveying that âthe cellular mobile telephone connection of a subscriber deactivated for non-usage/disconnection on request of subscriber, shall not be allocated to any other subscriber till the expiry of a minimum period of 90 days, or such longer period as may be specified by the licensee, from the date of deactivation/disconnectionâ.Trai said Mobile Number Revocation List was a digitally signed list of permanently disconnected mobile numbers.You may also like to watch:SC raises concerns about lack of transparency in Electoral Bonds scheme; govt backs privacy
