Many of them asked us why are we so rigid and why are we not allowing girls to study here. After receiving so many requests we discussed the matter with the bishop and under his supervision we embarked on a new journey to create a new history before celebrating its 200 years."The school managing committee has decided that the doors will be open for Plus II girl students to study in Class IX and Class XII.

They will be allowed to take admission from 2024 session and will be accommodated at our main building on Bidhan Sarani," Sanyal added.Alexander Duff was the first overseas missionary of the Church of Scotland to India. On July 13, 1830 he founded the General Assembly's Institution in Calcutta, now known as the Scottish Church College & Scottish Church Collegiate School.
