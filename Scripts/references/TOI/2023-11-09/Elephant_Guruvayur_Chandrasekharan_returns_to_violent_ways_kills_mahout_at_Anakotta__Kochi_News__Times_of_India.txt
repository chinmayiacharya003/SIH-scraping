GURUVAYUR: A 36-year-old mahout was gored to death by elephant Guruvayur Chandrasekharan on Wednesday at the Anakotta (elephant enclosure) where it had been tethered. The single-tusker was taken to the Srikrishna temple last week after a gap of 28 years.The deceased O A Ratheesh, the second mahout, was attacked while he was serving the jumbo water around noon.Ratheesh handled Chandrasekharan on Wednesday as a temporary substitute since first mahout K K Byju was on leave. Ratheesh, who was strangled and later thrown away by the tusker, was rushed to a private medical college hospital near Thrissur but could not be saved.Chandrasekharan, nearly 60 years old, has been tethered to the elephant yard for nearly three decades. Mahouts and devaswom authorities were scared to take it out because of the troubles it had created in the past. The tusker had reportedly attacked a mahout, a cinema theatre, and even fellow elephants once or twice when paraded at festivals.
