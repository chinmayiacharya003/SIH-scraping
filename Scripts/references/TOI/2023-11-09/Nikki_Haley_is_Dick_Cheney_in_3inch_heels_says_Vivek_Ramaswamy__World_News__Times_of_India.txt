During the third 2024 Republican presidential debate in Miami, GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy launched a personal attack on fellow candidate Nikki Haley, comparing her foreign policy views to those of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. The exchange occurred while the candidates were discussing Israel's war with Hamas.Ramaswamy, a businessman and entrepreneur, criticized Haley for her alleged ties to the military-industrial complex, saying, "She becomes a military contractor.She joins the board of Boeing... and is now a multimillionaire." He then posed a question to the audience, asking if they wanted a leader like Haley or "Dick Cheney in three-inch heels".Haley, a former UN ambassador, responded by correcting Ramaswamy, saying, "I wear five-inch heels, and I don't wear them unless you can run in them." She then added, "I wear heels, they're not for a fashion statement, they're for ammunition".The exchange between Ramaswamy and Haley was part of an ongoing feud between the two candidates over foreign policy, particularly regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict.Haley and Ramaswamy also engaged in a heated exchange over US support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. After Ramaswamy finished a lengthy answer about his opposition to US support for Ukraine, Haley turned and indicated his podium, stating, âI am telling you, Putin and President Xi are salivating at the thought that someone like that could become president,â referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.This exchange recalled the second debate, during which Haley repeatedly criticized Ramaswamy, including declaring, âEvery time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumberâ.The Republican Partyâs internal division over Russia's war in Ukraine was on display at the debate.The feud between Haley and Ramaswamy has been escalating, with Haley accusing Ramaswamy of having "personal conflicts of interest" and saying that he should be "disqualified from being president," accusing him of having views similar to those of the far-left "squad" in Congress.In a previous debate, Haley called Ramaswamy "scum" during a heated exchange about whether to ban TikTok.The tension between Haley and Ramaswamy has been hard to miss, as both candidates are Indian-Americans running for the Republican presidential nomination, even though polling points to an Indian diaspora that overwhelmingly votes Democrat.(With inputs from agencies)
