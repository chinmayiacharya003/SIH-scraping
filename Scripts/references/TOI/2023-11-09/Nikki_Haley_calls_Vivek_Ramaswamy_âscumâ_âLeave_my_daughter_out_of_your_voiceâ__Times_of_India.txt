During the third Republican presidential debate in Miami, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy brought up former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley's daughter while discussing the video-sharing app TikTok. Ramaswamy mentioned that Haley's daughter had been using the app for a long time, saying, "So you might want to take care of your family first".Haley responded by calling Ramaswamy "scum" and telling him to "leave my daughter out of your voice".The exchange prompted boos from the audience at the debate.TikTok was a key talking point during the debate, with the GOP White House hopefuls sparring over foreign policy. Many have called for a ban on the app in the US.Ramaswamy, a businessman with no political experience, aimed to disrupt the stage and attack his opponents. His candidacy had been fading since the first debate, and he seemed determined to be a spoiler, throwing elbows in every direction.Ramaswamy's first targets were former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. In a discussion about the conflict in Israel, he warned that the two leading candidates on the stage could drag America into a bloody war in Europe. He also speculated that DeSantis wears lifts inside his boots, saying, "Do you want Dick Cheney in three-inch heels? Because you've got two of them on stage tonight," in reference to Haley and DeSantis.Haley responded to Ramaswamy's comment by saying, "They're five-inch heels, and I don't wear them unless I can run in them. They are not a fashion statement, they are ammunition"Haley and Ramaswamy were joined on stage by three other Republican White House contenders: Florida governor Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott.The GOP front-runner, former President Trump, did not participate in the debate. In fact, Trump has not taken part in any GOP presidential debate so far, saying everyone knows about him.(With inputs from agencies)
