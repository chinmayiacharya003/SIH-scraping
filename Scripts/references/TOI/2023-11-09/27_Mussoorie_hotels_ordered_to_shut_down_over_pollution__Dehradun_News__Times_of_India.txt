MUSSOORIE: In a strict and unprecedented crackdown, the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board (UPCB) on Wednesday issued notices to 27 hotels - some of them luxurious and prominent - in Mussoorie, ordering them to shut down their properties with immediate effect. UPCB has also written to the power corporation to cut electric supply to these properties.The move to crack down on hotels has come after the NGT pulled up UPCB for failing to take action against hotels drawing excess water from the springs in Mussoorie, or those whose sewage disposal was not adequate.Of the 27 hotels, nine were operational when the UPCB team inspected the sites while the rest were closed either due to renovation or other factors, an official said.In an “action taken report” submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on November 6, UPCB said it had monitored 282 hotels/ homestays and found 215 of them had valid consolidated consent and authorization . Show cause notices have now also been issued to two premier hotels in the town – WelcomHotel Savoy and Jaypee Residency Manor – in which a fine of Rs 50 lakh on Savoy and Rs 10 lakh on Jaypee has been slapped as compensation “for causing damage to the environment”. Speaking to TOI, Sushant Kumar Pattnaik, member secretary of UPCB, said the 27 hotels that did not have valid consent to operate have been issued closure notices. “The notices to the two top hotels have been issued for illegally drawing water from springs in Mussoorie, and we have given them 30 days to reply,” Pattnaik said. Responding to a query by TOI, R K Kala, assistant general manager (finance) of Jaypee Residency Manor said the hotel management has not been informed about any penalty slapped on the hotel. “I am not aware about any notice so I am unable to comment on our future course of action,” he said.
